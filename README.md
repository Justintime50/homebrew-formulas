[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a fantastic package manager for macOS and Linux. I release some of my projects via Homebrew as it is widely used and easy to deploy to. This tap is a "self hosted" collection of Homebrew packages. For specific details about a formula contained in this tap, visit that formula's homepage.

## Usage

```bash
# Setup tap
brew tap justintime50/formulas

# Check the tap for available formulas
brew search justintime50/formulas
```

## Development

```bash
# Audit a formula (lint)
brew audit <formula_name>

# Test a formula
brew test <formula_name>

# Create a tar
tar -czf name-of-tar.tgz path/to/content

# Get the checksum of an archive
shasum -a 256 name-of-tar.tgz
```
